# ml-classification-exercise
An exercise repository for classification with iris dataset.
Script 1 analyses the data, script 2 is a trial of various classification algorithms one at a time,
script 3 compares more classification algorithms at the same time also through whisker plots.
I also gave tpot library a quick try to obtain a ml pipeline via a genetic algorithm.
